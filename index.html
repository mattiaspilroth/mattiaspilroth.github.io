      <p>
        I work on the strategic and technical foundations of cybersecurity
        in safety-critical industrial environments.

        My focus is on designing resilient OT architectures that hold up when
        enterprise IT requirements collide with operational reality, long
        system lifecycles, and constrained connectivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than isolated controls, I focus on foundations: identity, trust,
        network boundaries, and risk management models that can be sustained
        by the line organization over time.
