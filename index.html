      <h1>Mattias Pilroth</h1>
      <p>
        Designing resilient cybersecurity architectures for industrial systems,
        where operational reality matters more than assumptions.

    <section>
      <p>
        I work on the strategic and technical foundations of cybersecurity in
        safety-critical industrial environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        My focus is on OT architectures that hold up when enterprise IT
        requirements collide with long system lifecycles, constrained connectivity,
        and operational priorities in industrial environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than isolated controls, I focus on foundations: identity, trust,
        network boundaries, and risk management models that can be sustained by the
        line organization over time.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Areas of focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Industrial identity and access foundations for OT system lifecycles</li>
        <li>Risk management through assessments and targeted technical controls</li>
        <li>Network boundaries and segmentation patterns in industrial environments</li>
        <li>Translating regulatory intent (for example NIS2) into operational engineering</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Public technical notes</h2>
      <p>
        Public notes documenting architectural reasoning, technical edge
        cases, and failure modes encountered in real OT environments.
